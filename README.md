take anyhtin here with grain of salt
but basically i wanted to see how bad the corona thing is gonna be in copenhagen
so i just did this monte carlo simulation, fitted some parameters and then guestimated parameters after denmark decided to stop testing and do total lockdown. depending on how the "meet" parameter goes now it can drastically change the number of cases happening at once, which causes more deaths so take this lock down seriously even tho its not enforced as drastically as in china. keep masks for infected and nurses, so dont go crazy on masks, i found the rate parameter after lockdown did little about the oscilations... keepin the meet parameter at 0 or 1 is the most important, but also keep "meet" parameter low by not smudging more people fluids in your face and not blowing your fluids in other peoples faces. do the dab when you cough.
