take anyhtin here with grain of salt
but basically i wanted to see how bad the corona thing is gonna be in copenhagen
so i just did this monte carlo simulation, fitted some parameters and then guestimated parameters after denmark decided to stop testing and do total lockdown. depending on how the "meet" parameter goes now it can drastically change the number of cases happening at once, which causes more deaths so take this lock down seriously even tho its not enforced as drastically as in china. keep masks for infected and nurses, so dont go crazy on masks, i found the rate parameter after lockdown did little about the oscilations... keepin the meet parameter at 0 or 1 is the most important, 2 would be fatal, but also keep "meet" parameter low by not smudging more people fluids in your face and not blowing your fluids in other peoples faces. do the dab when you cough.

throu monte carlo and parameter fittin and all i found that in average a person smudges when they are careless 23 peoples fluids in their face per day, and it would infect them 19% of the time... tho the monte carlo would be more accurate if i did more experiments which would take longer runtime, and ideally spread out over serveral processes running in paralel but i cant be assed to do that since this is boring, im not getting paid for this, and i dont think anyone will use this code anyway.
